# SIMP Processor Project - Simulator and Assembler

This project features a C-based simulator and assembler for the SIMP processor, a MIPS-inspired model. The simulator runs a virtual CPU environment by handling instruction execution and I/O interactions, and the assembler converts assembly code to machine code. Test programs assess the accuracy of the implementation, offering hands-on experience with computer architecture and low-level programming.
